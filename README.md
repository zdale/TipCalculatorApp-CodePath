Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Gives the amount of money to split the bill between a selected amount of people

## Notes

There was only one moderate issue that I had to overcome when creating the app.  My issue was that I have a previous understanding of coding logic, but I did not quite know all of the swift syntax/strategy well enough.   Basically I became too confident in my understanding of Xcode and swift too soon. This lead to me accidentally not pointing the segmented controls to the right outlets or events.  As a result of that, there was a lot of confusing and frustrating errors when I ran the simulator.  Eventually I realized this and found what was wrong and got both segmented controls working correctly.  All was well after that.
